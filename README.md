Hi, I'm Justin.
This is my code repository for my projects: big, small, or somewhere in between.
I'm working on my Bachelor's of Computer Science right now.
Most of the projects will either be in C++, C#, or Java. Some of them may be in Python or Kotlin, or maybe something else. Who knows.

DISCLAIMER: This is not an all-inclusive, nor are all projects complete/commented. I do plan to go through and redo/comment the code to make it prettier and more easily understood.
