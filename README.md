Hi, I'm Justin.
This is my code repository for my projects, big, small, or somewhere in between.
I'm working on my Bachelor's of Computer Science right now.
Most of the projects will either be in C++, C#, or Java. I am going to add more comments to my projects at some point. I realized I need to have a github to 'showcase' my programming skills, so I prioritized uploading a few projects to do so, with few comments.......
